    <h1>Refreshing Mango Sago</h1>
    <img src="../images/mango-sago.jpg" alt="mango sago" width="400" height="400">
    <p>This dessert is a favorite during the summer with its tropical and creamy taste. The mix of mango with cream and sago 
        creates a comforting and cooling taste that will make you come back for more. Mango is personally my favorit fruit 
        which is why I consider mango sago as the most superior version of the sago series of desserts. The best part that this 
        is so easy to make in a big batch and doesn't require technical skill.
